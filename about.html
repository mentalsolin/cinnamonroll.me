            <p>A cinnamon roll consists of a rolled sheet of yeast-leavened dough onto which a cinnamon and sugar mixture (and raisins or other ingredients in some cases) is sprinkled over a thin coat of butter. The size of a cinnamon roll varies from place to place, but many vendors supply a smaller size about 5 centimeters (2.0 in) in diameter and a larger size about 10 cm (3.9 in) to a side. The larger variety can be found in Finland, called korvapuusti, where it can be up to 20 cm (7.9 in) in diameter and weigh up to 200 g (7.1 oz).</p>
            <p>In the American Midwest, especially Nebraska and Kansas, cinnamon rolls are commonly eaten with chili. In Canada, they are known as cinnamon buns. They are usually self-glazed and not iced, nor do they usually have raisins. They can have so much cinnamon that they are spicy and hot to the taste. American cinnamon rolls are frequently topped with icing (usually confectioners&#39; sugar-based) and are sometimes fried, finished with glaze, and served as a variation of a raised donut.</p>

In Austria and Germany, it is called Zimtschnecke.</p>
